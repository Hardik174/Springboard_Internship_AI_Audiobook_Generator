--- Page 3 ---
[Thoughtful Pace]
The first game, focused on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), includes an energy bar that needs to be filled before the player can shoot at targets. This design encourages patience and timing, thereby improving impulse control and planning skills. The game lasts approximately three minutes and serves to assess motor regulation and precision. [Pause]

Metrics gathered during this game include:
- Control Failures (ft_cf): Mistakes in navigation or inappropriate responses indicate a lapse in attention.
- Mean Movement Variability (ft_mmv): Inconsistent movement patterns suggest difficulties with sustained attention.
- Excessive Input Intensity (ft_eii): Overuse or strong inputs may signal hyperactivity.
- Target Precision (ft_tp): Low accuracy in target alignment points to impulsivity and poor planning. [Pause]
This game offers valuable insights into the interplay of cognitive and motor functions, as well as behavior control. These insights are relevant to visual tracking and motor coordination tests frequently used in ADHD evaluations. [Pause]

[Moving Forward Tone]
Next up, we have Dysgraphia, a learning disability affecting fine motor skills and a child's ability to produce legible and coherent written language. Symptoms may include inconsistent handwriting, irregular spacing, spelling difficulties, and challenges in organizing ideas on paper. [Pause]

To tackle this issue, a gamified dysgraphia screening tool has been developed. This innovative tool features an interactive front-end interface combined with deep learning and generative AI, providing a non-invasive, child-centered initial screening that can be easily implemented in school environments without requiring clinical settings or specialized oversight. [Pause]

2.2.1 Game Design and Workflow
The game is front-end based around a historical narrative theme, suitable for children aged 7 to 14 years old. Upon launching the game:
- The child is prompted to enter their name and age.
- A brief, age-appropriate paragraph based on a historical event is displayed on screen.
- The user is then asked to copy the paragraph in their handwriting under a fixed time constraint.
- After completion, the child uploads an image of their handwriting via the platform. [Pause]

2.2.2 Model Architecture and Technical Workflow
The uploaded image is processed through a deep learning pipeline built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The steps include:
- Preprocessing: All images are normalized to a pixel range of [0,1] and resized to 224×224 pixels.
- CNN: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was created with the following layers:
  1. Three convolutional layers (ReLU activation).
  2. Two layers for max-pooling.
  3. Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
  4. Fully connected dense layers leading to a sigmoid output for binary classification. [Pause]
The model training was done on a custom-labeled dataset split into 80% training and 20% testing. Binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizers were employed. Over 30 epochs, the model achieved:
- Training accuracy: 81.2%
- Validation accuracy: 78.4%
- Precision: 0.77
- Recall: 0.81
- F1 Score: 0.79 [Pause]
To enhance prediction confidence and generalization across diverse handwriting styles, an ensemble strategy was used that includes ResNet50, MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, and soft voting to yield an overall accuracy of 82.7%. [Pause]

[Fig 2: CNN used for Dysgraphia diagnosis based on handwriting images]

 [Narration]

[Previously]
In our exploration of prediction confidence and generalization across diverse handwriting styles, we employed an ensemble strategy. This strategy consisted of ResNet50, MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, and soft voting to achieve a commendable overall accuracy of 82.7%. [Pause]

[Section Title - Figure 2: CNN used for Dysgraphia Diagnosis based on handwriting images]
Now, let's delve into the workhorse of this process—the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) we've utilized to diagnose Dysgraphia from handwriting images. [Pause]

[Image 1 - OCR - Tesseract]
Here's a breakdown of our CNN architecture, as analyzed by Tesseract:

Conv2D, MaxPool, Flatten, and Input layers with ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation. The input shape is a 256x256 image with three color channels (RGB). Followed by 32 filters, each 2x2 in size, applied in two consecutive pooling operations.

The output from these layers then goes through another series of Conv2D, MaxPool, and Flatten operations, followed by a layer of Dense with ReLU activation, before reaching the final Dense layer with Sigmoid activation. This final layer outputs a single unit representing either Dysgraphia or Non-Dysgraphia. [Pause]

[Image 1 - OCR - EasyOCR]
Let's take a quick look at the same CNN architecture, this time as analyzed by EasyOCR:

Very similar to what Tesseract identified, we have Dysgraphia, Conv2D, MaxPool, Flatten, Dense, and ReLU layers. The input is again a 256x256 RGB image, with the initial layers consisting of 32 filters, each 2x2 in size, applied in two consecutive pooling operations.

Following this, we have three layers of Dense, all followed by ReLU activation. The final layer consists of a single unit and Sigmoid activation, similar to what Tesseract identified. [Pause]

[Continuation]
By understanding the intricacies of our CNN architecture and the ensemble strategy employed, we've been able to successfully diagnose Dysgraphia with promising accuracy rates. In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into the results obtained from this process. Stay tuned! [Pause]

Here's a visual representation of how machine learning can help detect, predict, and conclude the likelihood of Dysgraphia in a child. [Pause]

[Page Turn Sound Effect]

3. Dyslexia

[In a serious, informative tone]
Now, let's shift gears and tackle Dyslexia - the learning disorder that affects a person's ability to read, write, spell, and decode words. [Pause]

We've researched recent papers on Dyslexia and identified key features for prediction. To help children with dyslexia, we've developed five games:

[Game 1: Bubble Bay]
First up is Bubble Bay - a game designed to enhance orthographic awareness by helping children practice letter recognition. [Pause]

[Game Utility Explanation]
This game targets a core visual perceptual difficulty associated with dyslexia, making it essential for children who struggle with processing and recognizing letter forms. [Pause]

[Game 2: Word Reef]
Next is Word Reef - a game that assesses lexical decision-making by requiring children to identify correctly spelled words from visually similar distractors. [Pause]

[Game Utility Explanation]
This game helps in identifying difficulties with word-level decoding, as dyslexia often impairs the ability to recognize appropriate word forms and differentiate between confusing or phonetically similar words. [Pause]

[Continuation of Games]
And the list goes on: Memory Cove, Spell Shore, and Sentence Sea - each game designed to address specific challenges faced by children with dyslexia. [Pause]

[Conclusion]
This system offers a friendly, interactive method for early identification of Dysgraphia and Dyslexia, making it a non-invasive testing framework supported by data-driven insights. [Pause]
