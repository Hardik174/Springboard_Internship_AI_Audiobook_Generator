Abstract—In this project, we introduce an interactive 
game-based approach to the initial diagnosis of learning 
disabilities in children. The system is particularly designed for 
four types of learning disabilities, namely, Dyslexia, Attention 
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Dyscalculia, and 
Dysgraphia, and is targeted towards children between the age 
group of 6 to 17 years. A detailed set of four separate games 
has been designed in order to identify the behavioral 
characteristics of these disorders through interactive and 
fun-based play. 
Designed for direct use by students within the educational 
setting, the system serves as a pre-screening tool, hence 
reducing the amount of intervention by parents or teachers. 
Every game has been specially designed to evaluate 
corresponding cognitive and behavioral markers, yielding 
important information about the learning problems of 
students. This approach is intended to optimize the 
accessibility, engagement, and data-driven aspects of the first 
screening phase for education professionals. 
  
Preliminary evaluations of the four games have demonstrated 
promising levels of accuracy in identifying patterns related to 
specific learning disabilities. The Dyslexia machine learning 
model exhibited an accuracy rate of 94%, whereas the 
ADHDNet achieved an accuracy of 91.7%, along with a 
baseline model accuracy of 84.3%. The accuracy for 
Dysgraphia varied between 60% and 80% across different 
epochs. 
 
Keywords—learning disability, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, 
Dyscalculia, behavioral patterns, engaging gameplay, specially 
designed games, promising accuracy, early detection.

INTRODUCTION 
  
Many children worldwide are affected by learning 
disabilities, impacting their academic progress and overall 
development. Early identification and intervention are 
crucial for effective management of these conditions. 
However, these disabilities often go undetected due to a lack 
of awareness, knowledge, and resources. 
  
This research aims to develop a game-based screening 
platform to identify children aged 6 to 17 exhibiting 
behavioral patterns linked to common learning disabilities. 
The innovation involves four interactive games that require 
no supervision from parents or teachers. These games 
monitor responses for primary detection of learning 
disabilities. 
  
The project's goal is to bridge the gap between early signs of 
learning disabilities and timely professional diagnosis by 
providing a user-friendly tool for initial screening. By 
analyzing behavior during gameplay, the system supports 
educators and caregivers in recognizing potential concerns 
and pursuing further assessment if needed.

LITERATURE SURVEY 
[1] This document discusses the role of Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) as a tool for the 
screening of students with specific learning disabilities. [2] 
The paper addresses the enhancement of technology for 
teaching in lectures, tailored for school going students 
potentially 
having learning disabilities, providing a 
comprehensive analysis. [3] This study represents a critical 
review of the existing scientific literature regarding the 
application of ICT, Virtual Reality, multimedia, music, and 
their effectiveness for children facing special learning 
challenges. [4] The paper encapsulates the author’s insights 
into the difficulties encountered by children with reading 
and learning disabilities as they embark on their reading 
journey, alongside research focused on early identification 
and intervention strategies. [5] This paper explores issues 
related to the diagnosis and assessment of kids with learning 
disabilities in India’s context. [6] It examines the 
identification of microdeletion syndromes in patients with 
intellectual disabilities through the use of molecular genetic 
testing. [7] The investigation measures adherence within a 
controlled and randomized trial of a complex intervention 
aimed at supporting self-regulation for adults having 
learning disabilities and type 2 diabetes. [8] This study 
focuses on the co-creation of innovative tools in 
collaboration with individuals who have intellectual 
disabilities. [9] The exploration of the invisible aspects of 
learning disabilities remains a critical area, particularly 
concerning identification and assessment in the context of 
India, as mentioned in related scholarly works.

METHODOLOGY 
●​
The proposed methodology consists of a 
game-based 
diagnostic 
approach. 
The 
methodology 
is 
centered 
around 
the 
 


--- Page 2 ---
development and deployment of 4 distinct 
games, each tailored to specific learning 
disability, 
namely 
dyslexia, 
dysgraphia, 
dyscalculia, and ADHD. We have designed 
behavioral and cognitive pattern assessments 
for respective disorders. Each game targets 
specific key areas such as attention span, 
reading, number sense, and handwriting ability 
for each child’s interaction. The games are 
designed to be easily accessible without parent 
or teacher supervision. Furthermore, this 
system is scaled as follows- 
●​
In schools, all the children take the diagnostic 
test provided by us, targeting specific key 
features, aiming to detect early signs of learning 
disabilities. 
●​
Students, based on the results of the test, are 
shortlisted. 
●​
One-on-one interaction of shortlisted students 
happens with a clinically verified psychiatrist. 
Parents are informed the same. 
●​
Therapy sessions, as per the verdict of the 
psychiatrist, are taken on our platform. 
             
1. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) 
   Our platform offers three space-themed games designed 
for different age groups. These games identify behavioral 
patterns often linked to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder 
(ADHD), 
including 
inattention, 
impulsive 
behavior, and hyperactivity. These traits are key to clinical 
diagnosis and are measured through gameplay metrics. Each 
game gathers user interaction data, which is used in a 
machine learning model for predicting ADHD early. 
Moreover, these metrics give valuable information to 
clinicians who are monitoring the child's behavior. 
 
Fig 1: Working flow for ADHD detection 
Game 1: Galactic Defender (Wack-a-Alien) 
This game evaluates attention regulation and response 
consistency. Children are instructed to protect a space 
station by clicking on moving alien targets. At the same 
time, they must ignore unrelated visual distractions like stars 
and space debris. 
Metrics captured include: 
●​
Error Rate (sc_er): Missed or incorrect clicks on 
non-targets indicate potential inattention. 
●​
Task Completion Time (sc_tct): Prolonged task 
duration may signal difficulties in sustained 
attention.. 
●​
Response Time Variability (sc_rtv): Inconsistent 
reaction times show impulsivity. 
●​
Distracting Events (sc_de): Unnecessary or erratic 
clicks reflect hyperactive behavior.  
These metrics reflect behaviors commonly seen in clinical 
attention tasks, such as the Continuous Performance Test. 
Children with ADHD often find it hard to maintain 
consistent response patterns and may show impulsive or 
hyperactive tendencies. 
 
Game 2: Wait for Signal 
The second game simulates a Go/No-Go task. Children must 
respond only when a green "GO" signal appears. They need 
to ignore red or blue lights, as well as times when there is no 
signal. This activity measures impulse control and visual 
attention. 
Key metrics include: 
●​
False Positives (wfs_fpr): Pressing the spacebar on 
incorrect signals shows impulsivity.   
●​
Premature Responses (wfs_prc): Reacting before 
any signal appears also shows poor control over 
impulses.   
●​
Gaze Shifts (wfs_gs): Simulated eye-tracking 
tracks attention shifts; frequent gaze changes 
indicate distractibility.   
●​
Reaction Time (wfs_rt): The speed of correct 
responses reflects attention and processing speed.   
●​
Playtime Duration: Very long interaction time may 
relate to poor focus or distraction.   
This task is similar to tests used in clinical settings to 
evaluate executive functioning and attention control, which 
are important issues for people with ADHD.   
 
Game 3: Cosmic Pilot 
Cosmic Pilot challenges players to control a spaceship in a 
changing environment full of obstacles and directional cues. 
The child navigates using the arrow keys and must avoid 
collisions while keeping the target aligned. A unique aspect

of this game is an energy bar that needs to be filled before 
the player can shoot at the chosen targets. This design 
requires the child to show patience and timing, which helps 
improve impulse control and planning skills. The game lasts 
about three minutes and is meant to assess motor regulation 
and precision. 
Metrics collected include: 
●​
Control Failures (ft_cf): Errors in navigation or a 
lack of appropriate responses show a lapse in 
attention.   
●​
Mean 
Movement 
Variability 
(ft_mmv): 
Inconsistent movement patterns indicate difficulties 
with sustained attention.   
●​
Excessive Input Intensity (ft_eii): Overuse or 
strong inputs might signal hyperactivity.   
●​
Target Precision (ft_tp): Low accuracy in target 
alignment points to impulsivity and poor planning.   
This game offers insights into how cognitive and motor 
functions work together and how behavior is controlled. 
These insights relate to visual tracking and motor 
coordination tests often used in ADHD evaluations. 
 
 
2. Dysgraphia 
Dysgraphia is a learning disability that affects fine motor 
skills and a child's ability to produce legible and coherent 
written language. Symptoms may include inconsistent 
handwriting, irregular spacing, spelling difficulties, and 
challenges in organizing ideas on paper. Often, these 
issues are overlooked during the early stages of a child's 
education, which can lead to long-term academic challenges 
and decreased self-esteem. 
To address this issue, a gamified dysgraphia screening tool 
has been developed. This tool features an interactive 
front-end interface combined with a powerful backend 
powered by deep learning and generative AI. The module 
is designed to provide a non-invasive, child-centered initial 
screening that can be easily implemented in school 
environments 
without 
requiring 
clinical 
settings or 
specialized oversight. 
2.2.1 Game Design and Workflow 
The game is front-end based around a historical narrative 
theme, being suitable for children in the age group 7 to 14 
years old 
. Upon launching the game: 
●​
The child is prompted to enter their name and 
age. 
●​
A brief, age-appropriate paragraph based on a 
historical event is displayed on screen. 
●​
The user is then asked to copy the paragraph in 
their handwriting under a fixed time constraint. 
●​
After completion, the child uploads an image of 
their handwriting via the platform. 
2.2.2  Model Architecture and Technical Workflow 
The uploaded image is processed through a deep learning 
pipeline built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The 
steps include: 
●​
Preprocessing: All images are normalized to a 
pixel range of [0,1] and resized to 224×224 pixels. 
●​
CNN: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
was created with the following layers: 
1.​ Three 
convolutional 
layers 
(ReLU 
activation). 
2.​ Two layers for max-pooling. 
3.​ Dropout layers to prevent overfitting. 
4.​ Fully connected dense layers leading to a 
sigmoid output for binary classification. 
The model training was done on a custom-labeled dataset 
split into 80% training and 20% testing. Binary 
cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizers were 
brought into use. Over 30 epochs, the model achieved: 
●​
Training accuracy: 81.2% 
●​
Validation accuracy: 78.4% 
●​
Precision: 0.77 
●​
Recall: 0.81 
●​
F1 Score: 0.79 
To improve prediction confidence and generalization across 
diverse handwriting styles, an ensemble strategy was used 
that includes: 
●​
ResNet50 and MobileNetV2: Both pre-trained on 
ImageNet and fine-tuned on our dataset for feature 
extraction 
●​
The predictions from CNN, ResNet50, and 
MobileNetV2 were combined using soft voting, 
yielding an overall accuracy of 82.7%

2.2.3 Clinical Alignment and Feature Interpretation 
The following handwriting features were identified as 
significant indicators of dysgraphia: 
 
Table 1: Clinical Alignment and Feature Interpretation 
The following image demonstrates the use of machine 
learning to identify, predict, and conclude the possibility of 
dysgraphia in the child, which is essential for the early 
detection and further diagnosis.  
 
 
3. Dyslexia 
Dyslexia is the learning disorder responsible for hampering 
a person's ability to read, write, spell, and decode words 
despite having the intelligence to do so. A person having 
this disorder has difficulty in processing phonemes, which 
makes recognizing and manipulating sounds in words 
difficult. 
Based on the study of recent research papers on Dyslexia, 
significant features were selected to be calculated for 
dyslexia prediction. Keeping that in mind, we developed 5 
games: 
1.​
Bubble Bay: This helps in enhancing orthographic 
awareness because it enables children to practice 
letter recognition and thereby distinguish between 
very similar-looking letters, such as n/h and b/d, 
which are mirror image orientations of each other. 
Utility: Dyslexic individuals often struggle with 
processing and recognizing letter forms, especially 
those that are mirrored or rotationally similar. 
This game targets a core visual perceptual difficulty 
associated with dyslexia. 
2.​
Word Reef: This game helps provide lexical 
decision-making by requiring children to identify 
correctly spelled words from a collection of visually 
similar distractors. This helps in assessing visual 
word form recognition and error detection. 
Utility: Dyslexia often impairs the ability to 
recognize appropriate word forms and differentiate 
between the ones that are visually confusing and 
phonetically similar words. 
This system, in conclusion, can infer difficulty with 
word-level decoding. 
3.​
Memory Cove: This gamified experience targets 
working memory capacity, which is a cognitive 
domain often impaired by dyslexic individuals 
Utility: Working memory is closely related to 
reading fluency and comprehension. Dyslexic 
children often have limited verbal and visual 
working memory, which affects their ability to 
decode and retain language patterns. 
This system indirectly measures cognitive load 
handling and sequential recall. 
4.​
Spell 
Shore: 
Focuses 
on 
making 
phoneme-grapheme mapping and spelling skills 
better, thus training phonological awareness and 
orthographic precision. 
Utility: Spelling errors in dyslexic children are often 
systematic, which can be inferred from the 
phonological processing deficits underlying them. 
This game simultaneously provides a method to 
reinforce correct association. 
5.​
Sentence Sea: Helps in enhancing syntactic 
awareness by enabling children to arrange jumbled 
words into correct grammatical sentences, thus 
improving understanding of how a sentence is 
structured. 
Utility: Dyslexia may also impair comprehension 
and syntactic processing, especially in more 
complex reading tasks. 
This game, in conclusion, evaluates a child’s ability 
to mentally organize language. 
 
Overall, this system consists of early identification of the 
disability in a very friendly and interactive manner, making 
it a non-invasive testing framework. The model is supported 
by data-driven insights to identify patterns aligned with 
clinical symptoms. 
 
 
4. Dyscalculia 
Dyscalculia is a learning disability that specifically impairs 
a child’s ability to understand and manipulate numbers, 
recognize patterns, and apply basic math concepts. It often 
manifests as difficulties in number sense, sequencing, 
symbolic representation, spatial reasoning, and time 
management 
— 
despite 
average 
or 
above-average 
intelligence. 
To address this, our screening platform offers a suite of 
gamified, age-tailored assessments under a unified “Math 
Adventure” theme. These include: 
●​
Dot Counting Game (ages 6–7): Tests subitizing 
skills — the ability to perceive quantities without 
counting.​

Clock Reading Game (ages 9–12): Assesses time 
interpretation skills using analog clocks 
These games are embedded in a candy land-themed 
environment 
to 
reduce 
test 
anxiety and improve 
engagement. Each interaction is monitored and analyzed by 
a Large Language Model (LLM), which evaluates not 
only correct answers but the child’s reasoning process, 
error patterns, and consistency. This holistic approach 
enables early, low-pressure detection of dyscalculia-related 
symptoms, making the experience both effective and 
enjoyable.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE 
A.​ Conclusion 
The project aims to identify learning disabilities in 
children early through interactive game-based 
screening tools. Separate games designed for 
dyslexia, ADHD, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia 
allow observation of associated behavioral patterns 
and serve as primary assessment tools requiring 
minimal supervision. These engaging games can be 
used in various schools and provide valuable 
insights into learning capabilities. 
 
This approach detects early warning signs without 
a clinical setting, facilitating timely professional 
intervention. While the current implementation 
shows usability, further research will help to 
improve diagnostic accuracy and adapt the games 
over diverse educational and cultural contexts.  
 
 
 
B.​ Future Scope

enhancements can be thought of, to further improve this 
system’s functionality and applicability: 
●​
Integration with school systems: The games can 
be used across various educational boards by 
taking their inputs, thereby integrating the games 
with the school curriculum. 
●​
Age group support: By extending the games to 
age groups under 6 and adolescent learners, who 
may face challenges with these particular learning 
disabilities. 
●​
Technology-specific

●​
More personalized gameplay: Allowing users to 
get a more comprehensive and dynamic user score, 
which is personalized. 
●​
Incorporating 
neuro-adaptive 
feedback: 
Enhancing accuracy of diagnostics by monitoring 
stress indicators, attention shifts, and visual 
scanning behaviour during gameplay. 
●​
Extension of system-based architecture: We can 
extend the architecture to study neuroscience, child 
psychology, and linguistics, which provides a 
detailed analysis of the relationship between 
gameplay behaviour and neural learning pathways. 
By implementing these improvements, the system can 
evolve into a more versatile and robust solution, capable of 
meeting the growing demands for a high-quality learning 
disability identification system, which may potentially help 
in the early detection of the disabilities, leading to a better 
life.
